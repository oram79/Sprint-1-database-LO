-- Explanation Of Table Normalization

1NF - all 3 tables have a primary key and contains only atomic values with no
    repeating groups

2NF - all non-key attributes are fully dependent on the primary key. In the
    rentals table, customer_id and movie_id are foreign keys and contribute
    to the dependency without partial dependencies

3NF - All tables have no transitive dependencies, every non-key column depends
    only on the primary key of the table
